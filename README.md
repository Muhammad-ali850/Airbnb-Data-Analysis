# Airbnb Data Analysis

This project focuses on Data Analysis of Airbnb dataset using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. This dataset 
downloaded from Kaggle is comprised of five separate CSV files, each representing a different city. As I 
had to combine them for better analysis I used MySQL Workbench and connected the database to python. I performed 
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
The files were combined into a single master table using MySQL, then analyzed in Python.
This project highlights data analysis, database integration, and visualization through Pythonâ€™s core data 
science libraries.
